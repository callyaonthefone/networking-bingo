Now I have everything I need. Let me create a visually striking bingo card!

Here's your Startup Grind Tech Happy Hour Bingo Card — fully interactive and themed to the event!
The 25 squares are tailored to what Global Entrepreneurship / Tech Management students would realistically encounter at this casual NYC mixer, including things like:
Meeting investors, VCs, or developers
Practicing your elevator pitch
Discussing AI, global ecosystem differences, or funding stories
Finding collaboration opportunities or a future co-founder
Exchanging contacts you'll actually follow up with
How it works: Students click each square as they complete the activity. Get 5 in a row (row, column, or diagonal) and a BINGO! banner fires. The center square is a free space. There's also a reset button to start fresh.

ensure that all the squares are things that they can make happen during the event itself

Looking at the current squares, a few are passive or observation-based rather than action-driven. Let me revise all 25 to be things students can actively make happen during the event.

All 24 squares (plus the free space) are now things students can actively make happen themselves — no waiting to observe or overhear anything. Every task requires them to initiate: starting conversations, pitching an idea, asking specific questions, making introductions, proposing collaborations, or setting up concrete follow-ups before they leave. The emphasis is on doing, not watching.

What is the best way to have this accessible to students? The squares will need to mix up based on each student.
2:04 PM
Great questions — here's what I'd recommend:
For access, the simplest option is to host the HTML file on a free platform like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel and share a single link (or QR code) with students. They open it on their phone browser — no app download needed.
For randomization, right now all students see the same 24 squares in the same order. The fix is straightforward: define a larger pool of squares (say 30–40), then on each page load, randomly select 24 and shuffle their positions. This way every student gets a unique card just by opening the link.
Let me know which direction you'd like to go and I can help you with both:
The user didn't respond to the widget. Let me wait for their input.
Q: How do you want to handle randomization?
A: Shuffle the 24 squares into random positions
Q: How will students access the card?
A: Both — QR code + I'll host it
2:05 PM
Perfect. I'll add the shuffle logic and embed a QR code that students can scan to open the card. Since the QR code needs to point to a real hosted URL, I'll add a placeholder you can swap in once you've hosted it.

Read current bingo file to update it

Now I'll rewrite the JS to shuffle squares on load (persisting the order per student via localStorage), add a QR code section, and include hosting instructions.

Replace script block with shuffle logic, persistent card order, and add QR code + hosting instructions to footer

Now add the QR section styles:

Here's what's new:
Randomization — Every student gets a unique card. When they first open the link, the 24 squares are shuffled into a random order and saved to their browser. Refreshing the page keeps their same card intact. Hitting "Shuffle & Reset My Card" generates a brand new layout.
QR Code — A scannable QR code is built into the bottom of the page. Right now it shows a placeholder. Once you host the file, do one thing:
Open the HTML file in any text editor
Find this line near the top of the <script> block:
   const HOSTED_URL = 'YOUR-URL-HERE';
Replace YOUR-URL-HERE with your Netlify/GitHub Pages URL and save
The QR code will automatically generate in the correct brand colors. The page also includes step-by-step hosting instructions for Netlify — it takes about 2 minutes and is free.

Can you change out the following options for easier options:
Take a photo with a new contact and share it on social media
Get someone's email and send a follow up email before you leave
Propose a specific way you could collaborate with someone you meet
Set a speciric follow-up plan with someone before parting
2:15 PM

Edited 4 files, read a file
Edited 4 files, read a file
Done! Here's what the four swapped squares now say:
📸 Take a photo with someone new you met tonight
📧 Get someone's contact info and save it in your phone on the spot
🤝 Find something you and someone you meet have in common professionally
🌱 Tell someone one thing you're hoping to learn or do after graduation
All four are low-pressure and completable in a single short interaction.

walk me through setting this up in github
2:20 PM
Sure! Here's a step-by-step walkthrough. You don't need to know how to code — GitHub can host a single HTML file with just a few clicks.
Step 1: Create a GitHub account Go to github.com and sign up for a free account if you don't have one already.
Step 2: Create a new repository
Once logged in, click the + icon in the top right corner → New repository
Give it a name like networking-bingo
Make sure it's set to Public
Check the box that says "Add a README file"
Click Create repository
Step 3: Upload your file
Inside your new repository, click Add file → Upload files
Drag and drop your startup-grind-bingo.html file into the upload area
Scroll down and click Commit changes
Step 4: Rename the file to index.html GitHub Pages needs the main file to be called index.html. If you uploaded it with a different name:
Click on the file in your repo
Click the pencil icon (Edit) in the top right
Click the filename at the top of the editor and rename it to index.html
Scroll down and click Commit changes
Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages
Go to your repository's Settings tab (top menu)
In the left sidebar, click Pages
Under Branch, select main from the dropdown, leave the folder as / (root), and click Save
GitHub will show you a message: "Your site is live at https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/networking-bingo/"
It may take 1–2 minutes to go live.
Step 6: Add your URL to the bingo card Once your site is live, open startup-grind-bingo.html on your computer in a text editor (even Notepad works), find this line:
const HOSTED_URL = 'YOUR-URL-HERE';
Replace YOUR-URL-HERE with your GitHub Pages URL, save the file, and re-upload it to GitHub (repeat Step 3). The QR code will now be active.
Step 7: Share with students Send them the link or print/display the QR code from the bottom of the card — each student who opens it will get their own shuffled layout automatically.
Want me to walk you through any of these steps in more detail?
I didn't get the following "GitHub will show you a message: "Your site is live at https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/networking-bingo/""
2:26 PM
No worries — that message doesn't always appear right away. Here's what to do:
Check if Pages is actually enabled:
Go to Settings → Pages in your repository
Look at what's showing under the Branch section — does it show main selected, or does it still say "None"?
If it still says None, that means it wasn't saved. Select main, keep the folder as / (root), and hit Save again.
If main is selected and saved: The URL is automatically formatted as:
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY-NAME/
So just fill in your actual GitHub username and whatever you named the repository. For example if your username is jsmith and you named the repo networking-bingo, it would be:
https://jsmith.github.io/networking-bingo/
Try opening that URL in your browser. If you see a blank page or a 404, it usually just means it hasn't finished deploying yet — wait another minute and refresh.
To confirm it's deploying:
Go to the Actions tab at the top of your repository
You should see a workflow running called something like "pages build and deployment"
A yellow circle means it's still building, a green checkmark means it's live
What do you see when you go to Settings → Pages right now?
When looking at the bingo card on a mobile phone some of the text is cut off. how do I make sure that doesn't happen?
2:28 PM
The issue is that the cells have a fixed aspect-ratio: 1 (perfect squares), which limits the height and cuts off longer text on small screens. The fix is to let the cells grow taller on mobile and shrink the text more aggressively. Let me update it:

Edited 2 files, viewed a file, read a file
Edited 2 files, viewed a file, read a file
Here's what I changed for mobile screens (under 500px wide):
Removed the fixed square shape — cells can now grow taller to fit their text instead of clipping it
Shrunk the font and icons slightly to maximize how much fits in each cell
Tightened the gaps between cells to reclaim a few extra pixels
Allowed text to wrap more aggressively with word-break
Once you've tested it, just re-upload this updated file to your GitHub repo the same way you did before — drag, drop, commit — and it'll go live automatically within a minute or two.

Code · HTML 
can you walk me through updating this in GitHub?
2:31 PM
Sure! Since you've already set up the repo, updating it is simpler than the first time.
Step 1: Go to your repository Go to github.com, log in, and click on your networking-bingo repository.
Step 2: Open the file
Click on index.html in the file list
Click the pencil icon in the top right of the file preview to open the editor
Step 3: Replace the content
Press Ctrl+A (Windows) or Cmd+A (Mac) to select all the existing code
Delete it
Open the new startup-grind-bingo.html file on your computer in a text editor (right-click the file → Open with → Notepad or TextEdit)
Press Ctrl+A then Ctrl+C to copy everything
Go back to GitHub and paste it in with Ctrl+V or Cmd+V
Step 4: Save it
Scroll down and click Commit changes
A small popup will appear — just click Commit changes again to confirm
Step 5: Wait ~1 minute GitHub will automatically redeploy your site. You can watch the progress under the Actions tab — when the circle turns from yellow to green, your updated card is live.
Step 6: Test it on your phone Open your GitHub Pages URL on your phone and confirm the text is no longer cut off. If it looks good, you're all set to share the link or QR code with students!
